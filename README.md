# Gleaning Insights From School Testing Results with JupyterLab
## Purpose of Analysis
The Vanderbilt University Data Analytics Bootcamp is a streamline of coursework that exposes students to a broad set of technical applications and data management concepts, strengthening their problem solving skills in data-driven contexts. Module 4 focuses on using Pandas in Jupyter software to clean, group and analyze data from a CSV detailing results of test scores of students from several high schools.
